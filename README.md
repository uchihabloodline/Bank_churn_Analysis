# Bank_churn_Analysis
project for rajasthan hackathon 4.0
<h1>Customer bank churn analysis </h1>
<p> A ML application to find the churners for any bank. </p>

<h2> The problem </h2>

<p>Currently, Chinese commercial banks are facing triple tremendous pressure, including financial disintermediation, interest rate marketization and Internet finance. Meanwhile, increasing financial consumption demand of customers further intensifies the competition among commercial banks. To increase their profits for continuing operations and enhance the core competitiveness, commercial banks must avoid the loss of customers while acquiring new customers </p>

<h2>Scalability of the application </h2>
<p> All the online industry is facing this problem of customer churning. So this algorithm can be integrated with their applications too 
    for predicting customer churns and all any business or online customer serving industry or organistion. </p>
  
<h3> SOLUTION USING "ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS" </h3>
<p> As the market becoming more competitive, many companies
have started realization of the importance of customer-oriented
business strategy for sustaining their competitive edge and
maintaining a stable profit level at top line and bottom line. That
is, companies mainly rely on the stable income which comes
from loyal customers. However, creating new customers and
retaining loyal customers is difficult and costly. As new
customer account is setup different expenses like credit
searching, advertising and promotional expenses are occurred.
These expenses are several times greater than cost of efforts that
might enable the firms to retain a customer [8]. So, it has
developed into an industry-wide belief that the best core
marketing strategy for the future is to retain existing customers
and avoid customer churn </p>

<h2> idea behind solution </h2>
<p> An ANN is a complex network that comprises a large set of
simple nodes known as neural cells. ANN was proposed based
on advanced biology research concerning human brain tissue
and neural system, and can be used to simulate neural activities
of information processing in the human brain [16]. ANN has the
topological structures of information processing nodes that
distribute information in parallel fashion. The mappings of
inputs and estimated output responses are obtained via
combinations of nonlinear transfer functions. We can make use
of self-adaptive information pattern recognition methodology to
analyze the training algorithms of the artificial neural networks
using past experience, neural cells, memory and association, to
process fuzzy, nonlinear, and noise-containing data without
developing any mathematical models. The various algorithms of
the neural networks training are Hebb, Delta, Kohonen, and BP
computation.</p>
